# Project Title

Ecommerce website with Sanity CMS.

# Description

This is an e-commerce website that sells Nike shoes, and the website design is taken from Nike's website for learning purposes.
It uses Sanity CMS, which makes this website easy to maintain because allÂ  the product data is stored on Sanity's content lake.
And the data is coming to my e-commerce website dynamically. I built this website using Next.js, Sanity and Tailwind CSS.
